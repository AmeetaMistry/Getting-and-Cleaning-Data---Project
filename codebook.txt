Column 1 - subject is de-identified data for each of the 30 volunteers who participated in this project.  Values range from 1 to 30 for the 30 volunteers.

Column 2 - description contains values for the 6 activities (WALKING WALKING_UPSTAIRS WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS SITTING STANDING LAYING) performed by each of the 30 volunteers.

Columns 3 to 68 - are the mean and standard deviations calculated for each each of the activities of the 30 volunteers which was derived from raw data captured from a smartphone worn at the waist.

The raw data is derived as follows:
From the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. The acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag tGravityAccMag tBodyAccJerkMag tBodyGyroMag tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ fBodyAccJerk-XYZ fBodyGyro-XYZ fBodyAccJerkMag fBodyGyroMag fBodyGyroJerkMag. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
XYZ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X Y and Z directions.

Prefix 't' denotes time captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Prefix 'f' denotes frequency domain signals

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation
